# **Machine Learning for VIS-NIR Wax Mixture Regression**

The **visnirs-wax-mixture-regression** repository includes data processing methods and machine learning approaches applied to the analysis and characterization of petroleum wax blends. The focus is on classifying and predicting the composition of wax mixtures using VIS-NIR spectroscopy data.
